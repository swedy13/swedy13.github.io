Smartphone notes (Samsung Galaxy S4): 
 - No mobile responsiveness (boxes go out of view, nothing resizes)
 - very, verrryyyy slow on mobile

Tablet notes (Google Nexus 10):
 - I'm able to zoom out of the login page and see about 20% blank screen on the right


Performance notes: 
 - You seem to load jQuery(-UI) 3-5 different times (and different versions) on the login page
 - I can't register with a generated password >= 64 characters (alphanumeric, with or without symbols, spaces). It just sits on the registration page after clicking "Create Account" until it timeouts. Password of 'test1234' was used successfully. I note in your source you do not do ANY validation other than null-checking. You should set password rules (minimum of 8 characters, symbols allowed, etc...) so the user knows what to expect.

General notes: 
 - No page titles (says "My ASP.NET MVC Application")
 - Clicking the upper-left logo button causes a Server Error from the login page
 - Register page "Lastname" should read "Last Name"
 - Successful registration message should read "Registration successful. Please check your email to verify your account."
 - Successful registration should take the user somewhere (back to login page) and blank the form fields. 
 - The verification email should have the sentence "If you can't click the link above, ...". 
 - Overall, a successful registration took around 1-2 minutes. But the password issues really upset me as I'm a user of KeePass for password generation. A lot of people use password managers, make sure you support large passwords. 
 - User profile "Profile Picture" shows a broken image.
 - In "basic info" the "Measurements" area should have options "Imperial" and "Metric".
 - In "basic info" the "Height - inches" should be between 0 and 11, not 1 and 12. 
 - The "Edit Bio" button in the profile seems useless (or unecessary). This functionality should always be on. 
 - The "Location" autocomplete should show more than one guess (IE: "Manchester" shows "Manchester, UK" but only shows "Manchester, NH, USA" when I type it in fully)
 - In "Summoners", "add this account data" is redundant (they wouldn't be there if they didn't want to add it). 
 - The "Huddle" link causes a Server Error
 - I actually like that you can upload GIF animations to the profile picture. 
 - Searching for someone that doesn't exist causes a page to display "An error occurred while processing your request". 
 - Almost all of the footer links to go a different website
 - There's no way to change password or email address (no settings page. A settings page is where a user should go when they click his/her name at the upper right)
 - I can go back to the login page (after logging in), enter a wrong password, and still be logged in (can still access the profile area). 
 - I got 3 emails when I asked for one password reset. Not sure why...
 - Password reset also doesn't like setting a password >= 64 characters, it seems to do nothing
 - I was able to set my password to one character ";" and use it... probably want more security than that. 
 - Logout doesn't work at all. It sends me to the login page, but I can still go and edit my profile. 
 - There's no way to remove my account.
