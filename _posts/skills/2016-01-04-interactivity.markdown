<p>Interaction design (IxD) is the way a user interacts with a site or application.</p>
<p>Swiping through pages on a mobile phone or revealing a menu by hovering over it are good examples of interactivity.</p>
<p>While some prototyping tools provide interactive elements, the best way to perform interaction design is through live code.</p>
