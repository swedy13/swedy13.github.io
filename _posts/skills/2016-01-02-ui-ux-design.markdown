<p>User experience (UX) and user interface (UI) are two separate types of design.</p>
<p>UX focuses on how the user interacts with your site as a whole, whereas UI is about how your site looks.</p>
<p>UX tends to rely on analytics software and user research, while UI uses wireframing tools and graphic editing software.</p>
