A complete breakdown of the different techniques I use during the full development lifecycle. Most projects only require a handful of these, typically clustered within a specific category of work (ie design).

The development cycle breaks down in a variety of different ways, depending on who you ask. In general, I find there are four categories of work that need to be performed:
<ol>
<li><a href="#analysis">Analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="#planning">Planning</a></li>
<li><a href="#design">Design</a></li>
<li><a href="#development">Development</a></li>
</ol>

<p class="note">*Note: These steps are meant to be methodology agnostic, meaning that the words are just placeholders and don't conflict with other framworks (ie Agile).</p>


<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
I like to put "Analysis" at the front of the list, rather than at the end. There are two reasons for this, which I'll cover in a moment. However, before I do that, I want to break analysis down into three sub-categories:

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/user-feedback.html">User Feedback</a></strong><p class="newline">
Revolves around some form of customer interaction, be that surveys, interviews, or focus groups.
</p></li>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/flow-analysis.html">Flow Anlysis</a></strong><p class="newline">
Focuses on hard data ranging from web analytics to UX techniques such as card sorting or true intent tests.
</p></li>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/usability-reviews.html">Usability Testing</a></strong><p class="newline">
Based on consumer interaction with the live product, whether done in isolation and reported on later or performed live using screen capture or even eye-trackin/portfolio/page-optimization.htmlg technology.
</p></li>
</ul>

Now, because I'm a UXer, I prefer using a data-centric approach toward change management. Without a proper analysis of the problem, there's a good chance any attemps at a fix wil revolve around a partial solution at best. I see companies use "by-the-gut" development approaches all too often, and things rarely work as well as they could or should have. This is mainly due to a deficit in understanding what the problem really is, and the result is wasted time, money, and opportunity.

The other reason I like to push for analysis before moving to planning is because most of my clients have existing products and users. This means the majority of their development objectives are already based on some form of feedback, be that low conversions, high bounce rates, or customer suggestions. In my opinion, if you have the data, you should use it first and avoid spending money on less or even non-important changes.

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
While I like to do analysis first, I'm also used to working with clients who have already performed their own analysis and are ready to move to the planning phase. This process is about transforming an underlying problem (ie "low conversion rates") into a tangible solution (ie "improving conversion funnels"). It consists of three parts:

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/site-critiques.html">Site Critiques</a></strong><p class="newline">
Consists of a site (or site region) walkthrough to identify potential design issues which are reported using annotated screenshots and/or full documentation.
</p></li>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/information-architecture.html">Information Architecture</a></strong><p class="newline">
Targets application page structure and the pathways between pages to streamline user flow and enhance engagement.
</p></li>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/page-optimization.html">Page Optimization</a></strong><p class="newline">
Isolates page elements to identify key areas of improvement using techniques like heatmap engagement and A/B split testing.
</p></li>
</ul>

The planning processes primarily relies on standard design patterns to isolate potential problem areas. For example, the presence of a long form registration process is an indication that there may be design or architectural improvements to be made.

Page optimization provides a way to perform mini-tests to validate whether the assumed problem actually requires change. Using the previous example, it may seem like the long form registration process should be divided into a 3-stage sequence to improve conversions, but that assumption should be tested using A/B split testing as even standard design patterns are not appropriate for every situation.

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
The design phase fleshes out the development plan into a concrete objective that can be understood by all participants - the development team, the business owner, and prospective customers. It has three distinct components:

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/wireframing.html">Wireframing</a></strong><p class="newline">
Attempts to outline the general form of the proposed change. Avoids typography and element design in favor of a lightweight concept that can be easily modified.
</p></li>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/mockups.html">Mockups</a></strong><p class="newline">
Provide a graphical representation of the final product, including typography and complete element design. Can be low or high fidelity (ie quality) and may include responsive variants of each design.
</p></li>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/interaction-design.html">Interaction Design</a></strong><p class="newline">
Adds interactive elements to a wireframe or mockup so the user can experience on-page events (ie menus, pop-ups, etc) and page flow. Excellent for pre-development user testing.
</p></li>
</ul>

My preferred approach toward the design phase is to use wireframes and low fidelity mockups to flesh out a general idea before going to live code. I find that while high fidelity mockups look nice and feel good, they rarely make up for the additional cost, especially since all projects evolve during the development phase - rendering pixel perfect mockups useless.

I typically recommend avoiding interaction design unless the client wants to perform user testing (which is a good idea). For clients that want to head straight into development, interaction design is simply wasted time and money, and can often be accomplished almost as quickly in live code. That said, taking time to let a select group of users walk through and interact with a prospective design provdes valuable feedback that may dramatically change the course of development.

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
The last step is turning all the work from the previous steps into a reality. This is the "fun" part of the development cycle, but it's also the most difficult and dangerous. Creating a live application is time and money intensive, so it pays to get it right the first time. There are three variants of development that I'd like to cover:

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/prototyping.html">Prototyping</a></strong><p class="newline">
Creates a final "looking" product. This includes interactions and even sample data and users. However, the code itself is not production quality and shouldn't be used as the final product.
</p></li>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/web-apps.html">Websites & Web Apps</a></strong><p class="newline">
Deploys fully functional changes to the live site for users to interact with. The codebase should be successfully tested in previous prototype versions and refactored as necessary.
</p></li>
<li><strong><a href="/portfolio/mobile-apps.html">Responsive Sites & Mobile Apps</a></strong><p class="newline">
Employs the same approach as a website/web app, only with the additions such as design variations for smaller screens and/or using mobile-specific features like the device's GPS or camera.
</p></li>
</ul>

All development, whether a simple website or a cross-platform application, starts with a prototype. This is a rough draft copy designed to test the product and flesh out bugs. Once completed, the code can and should be refactored to reduce technical debt.

The final step is to deploy the tested codebase onto the live website or mobile platform. Depending on the client and scope of work, this could mean simply adding code directly to the site files (ie Wordpress) or using Git and Docker to merge the new code into the production branch.
