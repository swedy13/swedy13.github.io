Expore the different tools and applications I use, ranging from analytics software to design apparatus and more. You can also <a href="http://www.upwork.com/fl/markswedberg">browse my Upwork</a> profile to see test results for various tools and skill sets.

<table class="tools">
<tr><th>User Feedback</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
The simplest form of analysis is to simply ask for people's opinions. Providing questionaires or doing live interviews with individual users or a group of users is an excellent way to identify areas of improvement.

<tr><th>Flow Analysis</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
There are a variety of analytics tools that make it easy to get a detailed understanding of who your userbase is and how they interact with your site. Some of the more useful types of data include user acquisition, demographics, user flow, bounce rates, engagement, and heatmapping.

<tr><th>Usability Testing</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
In contrast to user feedback, this process is about watching users interact with the product through processes like screen sharing and eye tracking. The goal is to understand what people are actually doing and paying attention to, rather than learning what they think about the experience.

<tr><th>Site Critiques</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
This is similar in nature to performing usability testing. The key difference is that I do a walkthrough of your site and analyze the use of user experience design patterns. Rather than interacting directly with the web pages, I focus on identifying design elements and page flows that may limit user engagement and conversions.

<tr><th>Information Architecture</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
The first half of website design is about how the pages interrelate with one another and how the information on each page is displayed. Using standardized layouts and page flows makes it easier for users to interact with your site.

<tr><th>Page Optimization</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
The second half of website design is about how the elements on each page are styled. The size, position, color, contrast, and typography of various elements and text can have a dramatic impact on what actions users take on a given page.

<tr><th>Wireframing</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
The best way to start the design process is with a simple sketch that outlines the basic shape and layout of various on-page elements. I almost always start with a hand drawing, but will oftentimes translate that into digital form using a wireframing or photo editing tool.

<tr><th>Mockups</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
While it's technically possible to go from a wireframe to code, it's rarely a good idea. I recommend using low-fidelity mockups of at least a few key pages to define sitewide design patterns such as the color palette, stylistic paradigm, and potential css frameworks to use during the coding phase.

<tr><th>Interaction Design</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
I rarely pitch this step because most clients are only interested in getting to code. However, for anyone interested in getting detailed user feedback on their upcoming product, or for large projects, it can pay to get user feedback before coding the application.

<tr><th>Prototyping</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
This is the rough draft stage of coding. It's typically performed on a test server using sample users and data, or on a site mirror with archived data. In either case, the goal is simply to produce a working version of the final product without stressing out about code quality.

<tr><th>Websites & Web Apps</th></tr>
<tr><td class="description">
Websites tend to be content-oriented (like blogs), whereas web apps are more about interactions and dynamic data (think Google Maps). In either case, they represent a code base that runs on top of a platform and often uses multiple libraries and other software tools.
