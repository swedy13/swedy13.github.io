1. ATS Coaching
			Categories: Landing Pages, Website, Sports
			Backstory: I was asked to redesign the ATSC website to make it look more modern. During the discover phase I was able to identify several elements the client identified as modern, including ghost buttons, angled dividers, and background patterns. I combined these elements into a flat design, then added minimal shadows to a few of the key elements and animations.
