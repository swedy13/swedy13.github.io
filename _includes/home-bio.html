Initially I started with basic Wordpress sites and primarily focused on improving my marketing ability by honing skills like copywriting, advertising, split testing, and analytics.</p><p class="bio-description">In 2011 I started consulting for a small incubator, with projects ranging from hardware to renewable energy to manufacturing. My job revolved around advising startup entrepreneurs and providing services for various companies, most often marketing, user experience design, and project management.</p><p class="bio-description">After spending a couple years in the startup world and joined a small process management firm specialized in healthcare. That was 2014. The firm was working with the US Department of Veteran Affairs on clinical care applications, and I had the priviledge of helping with data analysis, work flow, and facilitation.</p><p class="bio-description">Then in 2015 I made my way into the world of programming. The majority of my career revolved around design and marketing, but for the first time I was able to create my own interfaces in living code. I loved it. In 2016 I decided to minimize my involvement in consulting and focus more on freelancing in an attempt to spend more time doing what I love - working in the intersection between information and design.</p></div></div></section>
